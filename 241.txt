https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/:
What is a domain name?
A domain name is a string of text that maps to an alphanumeric IP address, used to access a website from client software. In plain English, a domain name is the text that a user types into a browser window to reach a particular website. For instance, the domain name for Google is ‘google.com’.

The actual address of a website is a complex numerical IP address (e.g. 192.0.2.2), but thanks to DNS, users are able to enter human-friendly domain names and be routed to the websites they are looking for. This process is known as a DNS lookup.

What is the difference between a domain name and a URL?
A uniform resource locator (URL), sometimes called a web address, contains the domain name of a site as well as other information, including the protocol and the path. For example, in the URL ‘https://cloudflare.com/learning/’, ‘cloudflare.com’ is the domain name, while ‘https’ is the protocol and ‘/learning/’ is the path to a specific page on the website.

alixnamoussart/gh-pages-react > Settings > Pages > Custom domain > gh-pages.stashchuk.com > Save: 

adjust DNS settings of the stashchuk domain > Cloudflare > add a new CNAME record:
Type: CNAME 
Name:gh-pages
Target: mikegithubber.github.io

=>
gh-pages.stashchuk.com is an alias for mikegithubber.github.io and has its traffic proxied through Cloudflare.

KO with links to resources = not using relative urlz > package.json > "homepage": "https://mikegithubber.github.io/" > add and
commit > push > npm run deploy
=>
problem: Custom domain has been reset by deploy > reenter gh-pages.stashchuk.com > Your site is published at
https://gh-pages.stashchuk.com/

"Modified React homepage"

flaw = I need to reconfigure the custom domain each time the application is deployed
